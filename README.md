# NCAAM-Markov-Rankings-Final-Project

This application creates an NCAAM team ranking using the 2018 NCAAM season data in Google BigQuery. The ranking is created using a Logistic Regression Markov Chain model similar to what was used in [this](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jsokol/ncaa.pdf) 2006 paper by Paul Kvam and Joel Sokol. The [data](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/ncaa-bb-public/ncaa-basketball?project=oval-tributary-382017) was gathered using Google Cloud's BigQuery. Here is the power ranking for teams entering the 2018 NCAA Tournament.
